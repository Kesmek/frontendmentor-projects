## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS layers
- Astro
- Mobile-first workflow
- Open-props

### What I learned

I learned how to use the CSS BEM naming convention to more effectively organize
my css.

```css
.card__avatar {
  inline-size: var(--size-7);
}
```

### Continued development

I used the open props design system for this project and while I believe it's
sufficient for getting things going quickly, I do think it's missing some
intermediate variables. Moving forward I think adding my own variables on top of
the open props design system could be beneficial for my skills development.
