## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I continued to practice my CSS skills, particularly using BEM-style naming
conventions to keep my styles organized and reusable.

```css
.card__list {
  list-style: none;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: var(--size-3);
  inline-size: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on creating reusable components and exploring more
advanced CSS techniques like CSS Grid for layout. I also want to get more
comfortable with Astro's features.
